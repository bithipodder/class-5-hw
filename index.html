</h2>

<p class="blog detail ">Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology and society about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate: genetics (nature) and environment (nurture). The alliterative expression "nature and nurture" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period[2] and goes back to medieval French.[3]
    The complementary combination of the two concepts is an ancient concept (Ancient Greek: ἁπό φύσεως καὶ εὐτροφίας).[4] Nature is what people think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors. 
    Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g. the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.</p>
